## 📚 Naming & Structural Conventions

Here are naming patterns and repo-categories I observed:

| Prefix / Pattern | Intent |
|---|---|
| `guide-…` | Educational guides / reference / topic primers (e.g. `guide-system-design`) :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} |
| `rle-…` | Part of the learning product / “release / learning experience” modules (as you mentioned) |
| `hacktoberfest-…` / algorithm / contributions themes | Repos tied to contribution events, algorithm challenges (e.g. `hacktoberfest-algorithms`) :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} |
| No prefix (core names) | Core infra & product repos (e.g. `footsteps-app`, `news-api`) :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} |
| Utility / scripts | `initDev` (scripts to bootstrap dev setups) :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13} |
| Resource lists / curated | `learn-for-free` (resource collections) :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14} <br> `Python-scripts-collection` (utility scripts) :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15} |

These help new contributors intuitively pick where to go (guides, contributions, infra, resources).
