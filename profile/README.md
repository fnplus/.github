## What is fnplus?

fnplus (aka “fn+geeks”) exists to:

- Enable **learning through building**  
- Help contributors surface real work, not just toy projects  
- Provide infrastructure, prompts, and guidance for open source growth  
- Amplify visibility: your code becomes your signal  

We are global + inclusive.

## Pinned Repositories & What They Signal

These are the repos currently pinned in the org, showing what we give priority to:  
— join-fnplus-with-a-pr :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
— footsteps-app :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
— hacktoberfest-interview-questions :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
— curriculum :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
— community-project-ideas :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
— awesome-paths :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

These give newcomers a clear path:  
- **join-fnplus-with-a-pr** is the onboarding point to become part of the community :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **footsteps-app** is the core product / learning-path engine :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **hacktoberfest-*** repos tie into contribution challenges & events, like Hacktoberfest :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **curriculum**, **community-project-ideas**, **awesome-paths** represent learning content, paths, and idea catalogs :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## Naming & Structural Conventions

Here are naming patterns and repo-categories I observed:

| Prefix / Pattern | Intent |
|---|---|
| `guide-…` | Educational guides / reference / topic primers (e.g. `guide-system-design`) :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} |
| `rle-…` | Part of the learning product / “release / learning experience” modules (as you mentioned) |
| `hacktoberfest-…` / algorithm / contributions themes | Repos tied to contribution events, algorithm challenges (e.g. `hacktoberfest-algorithms`) :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} |
| No prefix (core names) | Core infra & product repos (e.g. `footsteps-app`, `news-api`) :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} |
| Utility / scripts | `initDev` (scripts to bootstrap dev setups) :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13} |
| Resource lists / curated | `learn-for-free` (resource collections) :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14} <br> `Python-scripts-collection` (utility scripts) :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15} |

These help new contributors intuitively pick where to go (guides, contributions, infra, resources).
