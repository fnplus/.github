# fnplus (fn+geeks)

Show your journey. Build in public. Grow your skills.  
_fnplus_ is a community-driven open source org where learners and contributors build visible work, together.


## 🚀 What is fnplus?

fnplus (aka “fn+geeks”) exists to:

- Enable **learning through doing**  
- Help contributors surface real work, not just toy projects  
- Provide infrastructure, guides, and prompts for open source growth  
- Amplify visibility: your work becomes your signal  

We are inclusive, global, and focused on impact.


## 📌 Pinned Repositories & What They Signal

These are the repos currently pinned in the organization — they signal priority areas and pathways to get started:

- **join-fnplus-with-a-pr** (onboarding entry point)  
- **footsteps-app** (core product / learning-path engine)  
- **hacktoberfest-interview-questions** (contribution challenges & event tie-ins)  
- **curriculum** (foundational learning guide)  
- **community-project-ideas** (ideas, prompts, tutorials)  
- **awesome-paths** (curated, topic-wise learning paths)  

These help new contributors see where to begin, how to explore learning, contributory challenges, and product-adjacent work.


## 📚 Naming & Structural Conventions

We follow naming conventions and repo categories that help orient contributors:

| Prefix / Pattern | Intent |
|---|---|
| `guide-…` | Educational guides, reference materials, primers |
| `rle-…` | Modules / components of the learning product (learning experience) |
| `hacktoberfest-…` / contributions themes | Repos tied to contribution challenges, algorithm sets, events |
| No prefix (core names) | Core product & infrastructure (e.g. `footsteps-app`, `news-api`) |
| Utilities / scripts | Tools like `initDev` to bootstrap or automate setup |
| Resource / curated | Repos like `learn-for-free`, `community-project-ideas`, `awesome-paths` |

This taxonomy gives a natural direction: guides → learning modules → infra → contribution / challenge repos.


## 🎯 How to Get Started & Contribute

Here’s a recommended path for new contributors:

1. Star the **fnplus** organization  
2. Fork & make a PR in **join-fnplus-with-a-pr** to become part of the community  
3. Explore pinned repos and understand naming conventions  
4. Pick an area of interest (guides, learning modules, product, challenges)  
5. Read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` in that repo and check existing issues  
6. Submit PRs — documentation, bug fixes, features, or idea proposals  
7. Engage: review others’ PRs, leave comments, propose improvements  

Every contribution helps refine the structure, clarity, and developer experience of fnplus.
